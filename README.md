This repository is full of useful data structures that I have made for classes or just for other programs I have made. I have a hankering for speed and the only prescription is getting as close to log(n) as I can.

I have been okay at this with my b_tree.

 This looks bad but it's much closer to log(n) than n or nlog(n). nlog(n) for data_size of 700k is about 9.4M so the fact that we're getting 500 when data_size is 700k is okay by my standards.
